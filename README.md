# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Calina

I'm a **physics student** exploring the universe one project at a time.  
Passionate about **science, code, and math**.

##  I'm working on 

-  Self-learning **Python** for data analysis and simulations
-  Building personal projects to explore physics concepts
-  Reading about **quantum mechanics**, **numerical methods**, and **computational physics**


##  Some Laboratory Projects Performed as Part of My Coursework: 
- Magnetic Field_Distribution in Solenoids and Circular Coils
- Analysis of Resonance and Phase Shift in Mechanical Oscillations
- Wave Propagation and Diffraction Analysis
- Spectral Analysis of Coupled Electrical Oscillations
- Voltage Sources Exploration
